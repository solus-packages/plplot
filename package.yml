   PLplot is a cross-platform software package for creating scientific plots whose (UTF-8) plot symbols and text are limited in practice only by what Unicode-aware system fonts are installed on a user's computer. The PLplot software, which is primarily licensed under the LGPL, has a clean architecture that is organized as a core C library, separate language bindings for that library, and separate device drivers that are dynamically loaded by the core library which control how the plots are presented in noninteractive and interactive plotting contexts.
